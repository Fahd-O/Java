# Java Programming Codes Repository

This repository is an archive of beginner-level Java programs I developed as part of an introductory programming course during a university course (CSC301: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java). These programs were written and executed using the VS Code editor and the command-line interface before transitioning to a more advanced IDE, the Eclipse IDE to be precise. These codes cover some essential Java programming concepts and serve as a foundation for learning object-oriented programming.
It is aimed at showcasing my fundamental Java skills and offering a resource for revisiting or demonstrating foundational programming concepts.
